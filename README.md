This repository follows an evidence-first delivery standard.

See [docs/EVIDENCE_STANDARD.md](docs/EVIDENCE_STANDARD.md) for the operating script that governs planning, implementation, review, release notes, and outcomes tracking.

## Quick Start

1. Read `docs/EVIDENCE_STANDARD.md`.
2. Use the templates in `docs/templates/` before starting implementation.
3. Open work as GitHub issues and link PRs to issues.
4. Record decisions in `docs/adr/` for non-trivial tradeoffs.
5. Log weekly outcomes in `docs/metrics/`.

  - `/projects` agentic projects, workflows, and metrics
- Compact landing `Poe` guide agent that:
  - asks “Hi, what brings you here?”
  - provides route-choice quick actions
  - supports general free-text guidance
- Messaging shift away from services/business positioning to career + execution proof profile.
